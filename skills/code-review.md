# Code Review Skill

When performing code reviews, follow these guidelines to provide comprehensive and helpful feedback.

## Review Process

1. **Understand the Context**: First read the code to understand its purpose
2. **Check for Bugs**: Look for potential runtime errors, edge cases, and logic issues
3. **Review Style**: Ensure code follows project conventions and best practices
4. **Assess Performance**: Identify any obvious performance issues
5. **Security Check**: Look for common security vulnerabilities

## Examples

- "Review the authentication module for security issues"
- "Check this function for edge cases and error handling"
- "Review the API handlers for best practices"

## Guidelines

- Be constructive and specific in feedback
- Explain why something is an issue, not just what
- Suggest concrete improvements when possible
- Acknowledge good patterns you observe
- Prioritize issues by severity (critical, warning, suggestion)

## Output Format

Structure your review as:

1. **Summary**: Brief overview of what the code does
2. **Critical Issues**: Bugs or security problems that need immediate attention
3. **Warnings**: Potential issues that should be addressed
4. **Suggestions**: Nice-to-have improvements
5. **Positive Notes**: Good practices observed
